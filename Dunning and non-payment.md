# Why have you received a notification that your Azure subscription has a past due balance?
## If you are paying by credit card
 If you forget to pay your bill, the Account administrator will receive an email notification or you will see an alert on http://accounts.windowsazure.com or http://portal.azure.com. 

##What will happen if you forget to pay
The service will be canceled and your resources will no longer be available. Any data will be deleted 90 days after the service is terminated.
## What can you do to resolve the issue
**Scenario 1**: The bill is not paid because the credit card on file is declined, or has expired.
Use another credit card or payment method for the subscriptions, or contact your bank to resolve the issue.  Click here to see how to change the payment method in Azure. You must be an account administrator to change the payment method.

**Scenario 2**: The bill notice was not received because the Account Administrator has left the company or changed roles.
