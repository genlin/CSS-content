#How to buy or sign up for an Azure subscription 
#Content:

This topic helps you with the following tasks:

* Sign up for an Azure Free Trial subscription
* Upgrade your Azure Free Trial subscription to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription 
* Activate your Azure subscription by using a Service Activation Key (a 5x5 key)

##Sign up for an Azure Free Trial subscription
To sign up for an Azure Free Trial subscription, you must have a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft Account username (formerly Windows Live ID).  We use the phone number and credit card for identity verification. We want to make sure that real people are using Azure. We do not bill anything to the credit card.  

1. Open the [Azure free trial page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/), and then click Try it now.
2. Sign in to your Microsoft account.
3. In the About you section, type your personal information. ![The screenshow of personal information](https://uyzcpq.by3301.livefilestore.com/y3pWAwibTF2ygY_2sOhwHst07dmXuFniPCqy9oheA7m6x1e-dRy_kJVDkB3v0PUxmpph3bsU61LVvhXDf7ns6jxAEWOJw46Az9Ni7hdjtWJc43ITM1NKK5ZTH9IaRl9K_1jWQz4NUBh1yUKQv2Gv38wZeCOmiE1ThRvuk7MpFpzCiE/1.png?psid=1g)
4. In the **Verification by phone** section, select the international dialing code for your country, type your phone number (Do not type the internal dialing code) and then click Send text message. You'll soon receive a verification code on your phone. Please use the code to verify your Windows Azure account.  

If you do not receive the message, please try the following methods:
* Use **Call me** option. 
* Use another phone number. 
* Contact [Microsoft Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=544831&clcid=0x409) for help.
