# Why have you received a notification that your Azure subscription has a past due balance? 
If you are the Account Administrator for your Azure subscription, and have not made your payment on time, you will receive an email notification about your past due balance or you will see an alert either on http://accounts.windowsazure.com or http://portal.azure.com.  

### What will happen if you forget to pay
The service will be canceled and your resources will no longer be available. Any data will be deleted 90 days after the service is terminated.

### What can you do to resolve the issue

Pay your outstanding balance in full. 

**Scenario 1**: If you are on an invoice mode of payment, send your payment to the location listed at the bottom of your invoice. If you need help, contact [Microsoft Support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade). 

**Scenario 2**: If the bill is not paid because the credit card on file was declined, or has expired, use another credit card or payment method for the subscriptions, or contact your bank to resolve the issue.
 
**Scenario 3**:  If the bill notice was not received because the Account Administrator has left the company or changed roles, contact [Microsoft Support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to resolve the issue.
