# Why have you received a notification that your Microsoft Online Services order has a past due balance?
If the invoice for the order is past the due date, you will receive the following notification in email: 

"Please note that your Microsoft Online Services Order ID {order number} has a past due balance. To prevent a service interruption, the past due amount must be paid in full in 28 days. "

**Note** Only the Account administrator will receive the billing notification. 
##What will happen if you forget to pay in 28 days
The service will be terminated in the fifth week after the invoice due date. The data will be deleted 90 days after the service is terminated.
## What can you do to resolve the issue
Scenario 1: The invoice is not paid because the credit card on file is declined, or has expired.

Scenario 2:    The bill invoice was not received because the Account Administrator has left the company or changed roles.
