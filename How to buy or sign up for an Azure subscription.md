#How to buy or sign up for an Azure subscription 
##Sign up for an Azure Free Trial subscription
To sign up for an Azure Free Trial subscription, you must have a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft Account username (formerly Windows Live ID).  We use the phone number and credit card for identity verification. We want to make sure that real people are using Azure. We do not bill anything to the credit card.  

1. Open the [Azure free trial page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/), and then click Try it now.
2. Sign in to your Microsoft account.
3. In the About you section, type your personal information.
